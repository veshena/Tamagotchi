## Description
Im going to be making a game called Vee Tamagotchi. The point of the game is to keep your pet happy. 
You have to feed, play and allow your et to sleep, if the number crosses 10 you when. When you pet turns 50 years old that would be the end of the game.


## User Story
1. The user clicks start and they must enter their name for the game to start.

2. The user must monitor the pet happiness otherwise your pet will die.

3. The user must click feed, play, sleep and keep it under 10 for the pet to stay alive.

4. If your pet gets to 50 years old your pet will die along with the message you lived a happy life.

5. When the game is over the numbers will stop and the user can click restart to reset the entire game.

# Project #0: The Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun—**a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!


---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* **HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.**
* **Git 20+ commits** Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
* **Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README** 
* **Wireframe:** - Basically draw out what your game will look like. You can use paper or any wireframe tool you find online.
* **User Stories** - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
    1.  The user click starts and the level starts
    2.  When the user hits the ```f key``` a fire ball is catuplulated at a target. 
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **JavaScript** for **DOM manipulation** (no Canvas)
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A working MVP (minium viable product) what is the absolute bare minimum functionality for you game, do not make it more complex until you've completed your MVP.
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* **A ``README.md`` file** with an explanation of what the project is, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable).  In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme. 
* A 10 minute presentation to your classmates and instructor, illustrating:
    * App functionality
    * Triumphs
    * Challenges
    * Words of Wisdom
    * Code snippets

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** _(a great reference for all things  Javascript)_
* **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_
* **[Example Readme Files](https://github.com/SEIR-7-06/example-readmes)** _(a great reference for planning materials)_

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, element inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* During the day, work through problems in class & **ask questions when you need to!** We're here to help prevent you from burning through your time with wild goose chases.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version. There should be _at least_ a couple dozen commits. 
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Plan to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
